# Human Resource Management System Project in Django with Source Code

A **Human Resource Management System Project in Django**, keeps track of all of the employee‚Äôs information and data.

We‚Äôve created all of the employee‚Äôs crud (create, read, update, and delete) operations.

Moving on, this is a role-based module in which the admin can perform any operation on the data, yet the employee can only see his or her own data, so access label limitations have been added to the project.

Anyway, it has Admin side which allows extra features like manage employee, attendance, leave, department, recruitment and payroll.
